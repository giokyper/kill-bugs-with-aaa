## How to send my practice
1. Clone this repo locally
2. Create a new branch locally
3. Make your changes over the created branch
4. Once completed, publish your branch and create a pull request (this can be done via [github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request))
